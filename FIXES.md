# NautScan Network Application Fixes

## Issue Summary
The application was experiencing issues with the connections display due to data structure mismatches between the frontend components and the backend API responses. This resulted in a TypeError when attempting to access properties like `packet.id.toString()` when the property was undefined.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Updated `useTrafficData` Hook
- Corrected the packet data mapping to properly transform API response into Connection objects
- Added proper type safety with optional chaining (`?.`) and fallback values
- Enhanced error handling and added better logging
- Updated the structure to match the Connection interface with nested objects for source and destination

### 2. Fixed Connections Page
- Rewrote the database connections mapping to handle various API response formats
- Updated helper functions to safely access Connection properties
- Added more robust error handling for database queries
- Updated the table component to handle both real-time and database connections

### 3. Standardized Data Model
- Ensured consistent handling of packet properties between database and real-time data
- Fixed property access through nested objects (`source.ip` instead of direct properties)
- Added fallback values to handle missing or undefined properties
- Improved direction detection using IP address patterns and traffic flow information

## Usage Notes
The connections page now properly displays both:
- Real-time network connections captured from the selected interface
- Historical connections from the database

When switching between modes, the data format is handled consistently to provide a uniform user experience. The application now properly handles properties from different API responses, including:
- `packet_id` for unique identification
- `source_ip`/`dest_ip` for endpoint information
- `protocol`, `length`, and ports as expected

## Testing
The application has been tested with both:
- Real-time API endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/packets/recent`
- Database API endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/packets/db`

Both endpoints now correctly display their respective data in the connections table.

# Sprint 4 Progress Report: 3D Visualization

## Completed Items
- ✅ Set up Three.js environment
  - Installed required dependencies (three.js, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei)
  - Added earth texture resources
  - Configured dynamic import with SSR disabled

- ✅ Created 3D world map component
  - Implemented Earth globe with realistic textures and bump mapping
  - Added rotating earth animation
  - Created starfield background
  - Designed component that works with the existing UI

- ✅ Implemented connection visualization
  - ✅ Added animated network traffic with curved connection paths
  - ✅ Implemented geographic IP mapping by converting lat/lng to 3D coordinates
  - ✅ Added connection type indicators with color coding
  - ✅ Created hover tooltips to display connection details

## In Progress
- Interactive controls
  - Basic orbit controls implemented
  - Additional features needed:
    - More detailed tooltips
    - Click-to-focus on specific connections
    - Time-based connection filtering

- Performance optimization
  - Need to optimize for large numbers of connections
  - Implement level-of-detail system for distant connections
  - Add options to filter connections by type or significance

## Next Steps
1. Complete interactive controls
   - Add camera animation to focus on selected connections
   - Implement connection filtering UI
   - Add zoom-to-location feature

2. Optimize performance
   - Add instanced rendering for connection points
   - Implement occlusion culling for hidden connections
   - Add render quality settings

3. Connect to real data
   - Integrate with real-time WebSocket connection data
   - Add time-based filtering
   - Implement auto-refresh of connection data

4. Add additional visualization features
   - Connection heatmap overlay
   - Traffic volume indicators
   - Day/night cycle visualization

## Technologies Used
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- React Three Fiber for React integration
- Drei for helper utilities
- Next.js for application framework
- TypeScript for type safety
